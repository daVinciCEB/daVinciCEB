### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my old account... I wanted to try and separate accounts between a "work" account and a "personal" account, but that ended up backfiring... I was just always writing side projects and repos on my new computer and it was on my new account, so, I'm merging them. All of my old repos and commits are being moved to my new account (currently @coby-spotim, but I will be changing the name as it is now going to be just a normal personal account).

To see what I've been working on for the past couple of years, head on over there!
